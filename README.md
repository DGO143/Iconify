# Iconify
Turn ugly hashes into beautiful icons

In this test I tried to take letters and replace them with icons and colors.
I'm still testing for collision issues. 

How it works
===
We transform letters into icons and numbers that come after will get transformed into colors.
If a letter dosn't have a number after it, it will be colored in black.
Symbols are displayed as they are. 

Pull requests are welcome.
