# Iconify
Turn ugly hashes into beautiful icons

In this test I tried to take letters and replace them with icons and colors.
I'm still testing for collision issues. 

How it works
===
We transform the 1st letter into an icon.
The second letter gets transformed into a color.
Each letter has a unique icon and color.
If the hash is impair, the last letter will be colored in black.
 

Pull requests are welcome.
